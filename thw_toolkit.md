# The difference between true and false

> In studies for which findings could be reproduced, authors had paid close
> attention to controls, reagents, investigator bias and describing the
> complete data set. For results that could not be reproduced, however, data
> were not routinely analysed by investigators blinded to the experimental
> versus control groups. Investigators frequently presented the results of one
> experiment, such as a single Western-blot analysis. They sometimes said they
> presented specific experiments that supported their underlying hypothesis,
> but that were not reflective of the entire data set.
