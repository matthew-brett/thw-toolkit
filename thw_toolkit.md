# The toolkit metaphor

> Since 1998, Software Carpentry has been teaching researchers the computing
> skills they need to get more done in less time and with less pain --
> [Software Carpentry website](https://software-carpentry.org/about).

# The journey is long

# Simple compared to easy

> The roots of "simple" are "sim" and "plex", and means "one twist". The
> opposite, which would be complex, is "multiple twists" or "braided
> together" ...
> The latin origin of "easy" is the root of "adjacent", which means "to lie
> near" and "to be nearby" -- Rich Hickey ["Simple Made
> Easy"](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy)

# Simple compared to easy

Simple: clarity, efficiency, basis for learning.

# You will be tempted to keep doing it the easy way

> A couple of months in the laboratory can frequently save a couple of hours

# But this will have terrible long term cost

# Choosing your tools

* Find efficient people;
* Learn from them!
* Read - e.g. Wilson *et al* (2017) [Good enough practices in scientific
  computing](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510)

# Choosing tools - simple rather than easy

3. THE BASIC TOOLS

    14. The Power of Plain Text
    15. Shell Games
    16. Power Editing
    17. Source Code Control
    18. Debugging
    19. Text Manipulation
    20. Code Generators

Programmer](https://pragprog.com/book/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer)

# Shell games

* Use the (probably Unix) command line for everything you can;

# Power editing

> **Use a Single Editor Well**
>
> The editor should be an extension of your hand; make sure your editor is
> configurable, extensible, and programmable -- The Pragmatic Programmer

# Source code control

You may not know it yet, but you will need:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com);
* (something like) [Github](https://github.com).

# A general purpose programming language

Prefer open: popular options are:

* [Python](https://www.python.org)
* [R](https://www.r-project.org) / [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com)

# Standard programming tools

* Finding the right libraries to use and contribute to;
* Testing;
* Continuous integration;
* Process automation with `make` and shell scripting.

# Notebooks

* [The Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org);
* [The R Notebook](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html)

# For example, for this presentation I

* Used plain text for everything;
* wrote it using the Vim editor;
* Stored it with Git and uploaded to Github;
* Used the Unix command line and `make` for building.

# Your tool here

Over to you.
