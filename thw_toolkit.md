# The toolkit metaphor

> Since 1998, Software Carpentry has been teaching researchers the computing
> skills they need to get more done in less time and with less pain --
> [Software Carpentry website](https://software-carpentry.org/about).

# The tools are standard

> Computers are now essential in all branches of science, but most researchers
> are never taught the equivalent of basic lab skills for research computing.
> As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than
> necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with
> software and data -- Wilson *et al* (2017) "Good enough practices in
> scientific computing"

# Simple compared to easy

> The roots of "simple" are "sim" and "plex", and means "one twist". The
> opposite, which would be complex, is "multiple twists" or "braided
> together" ...
> The latin origin of "easy" is the root of "adjacent", which means "to lie
> near" and "to be nearby" -- Rich Hickey [Simple Made
> Easy](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy)

# You will be tempted to keep doing it the easy way

> A couple of months in the laboratory can frequently save a couple of hours
> in the library -- Frank Westheimer

# But this will have terrible cost in the medium and long term
